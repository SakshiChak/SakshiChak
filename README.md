👋 Hey there, I'm Sakshi Chak, a passionate software developer on a quest to turn caffeine into code! ☕💻

💡 I thrive on creativity and specialize in crafting the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll often find me knee-deep in code, building captivating web experiences.

🔭 Currently, I'm immersed in crafting my digital portfolio, and the tools in my arsenal are [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript]. I'm on a mission to create something that not only impresses but also inspires.

🌱 My learning journey knows no bounds; I'm sharpening my JavaScript skills and diving deep into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with C++. It's like solving puzzles while creating art!

💬 Want to chat about C++, web development, or anything in between? Let's have a conversation!
